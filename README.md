## FPL Scoring Rules (Used in Predictions)

The prediction algorithm follows official FPL scoring:

### Minutes Played
- 1 point for playing up to 60 minutes
- 2 points for playing 60+ minutes

### Goals Scored
- Goalkeeper/Defender: 6 points
- Midfielder: 5 points
- Forward: 4 points

### Assists
- 3 points per assist

### Clean Sheets
- Goalkeeper: 4 points
- Defender: 4 points
- Midfielder: 1 point

### Other Scoring
- Saves: 1 point per 3 saves (GKP only)
- Penalty saved: 5 points
- Penalty missed: -2 points
- Yellow card: -1 point
- Red card: -3 points
- Own goal: -2 points
- Goals conceded: -1 point per 2 goals (GKP/DEF only)

## Available Statistics

### ✅ Available in FPL API (Used by this app)
- **Basic stats**: Goals, Assists, Clean Sheets, Saves, Minutes, Starts
- **Expected stats**: xG, xA, xGI (Expected Goal Involvements), xGC (Expected Goals Conceded)
- **Per 90 stats**: xG/90, xA/90, xGI/90, xGC/90, Saves/90
- **Performance metrics**: Form, Points Per Game, Bonus Points earned
- **Advanced metrics**: BPS (Bonus Points System score), ICT Index (Influence/Creativity/Threat)
- **Availability**: Injury status, chance of playing, news updates
- **Set pieces**: Penalty order, direct free kick order, corners & indirect free kicks order

### ❌ NOT Available in Public FPL API
- **Defensive actions**: Tackles, Interceptions, Clearances, Blocked shots
- **Aerial duels**: Headers won/lost
- **Passing stats**: Pass completion %, key passes
- **Dribbling stats**: Successful dribbles, dispossessed

**Note**: The unavailable stats (tackles, interceptions, headers) are Opta statistics used internally by FPL for BPS calculations but not exposed in the public API. Our BPS metric is a composite score that already factors in these defensive contributions.

## Prediction Algorithm

The enhanced points prediction system uses:

1. **Expected Stats per 90**: xG/90, xA/90 for more accurate projections
2. **Player Form**: Recent performance (last 5 games) weighted heavily
3. **Fixture Difficulty**: Adjusts expectations based on opponent strength
4. **Historical Statistics**: Goals, assists, clean sheets, bonus points, saves
5. **Bonus Potential**: BPS per game to estimate bonus point probability
6. **Playing Time Analysis**: Start probability based on minutes and starts data
7. **Rotation Risk**: Calculated from starts percentage and consecutive games
8. **Set Piece Role**: Penalty taker order for additional expected points
9. **Availability**: Injury concerns and chance of playing percentage
10. **Position-Specific Factors**: Different calculations for GKP/DEF/MID/FWD

### Difficulty Multipliers
- Difficulty 1 (Easiest): +30% for attackers, -30% for clean sheets
- Difficulty 2: +15% for attackers, -15% for clean sheets
- Difficulty 3 (Medium): No adjustment
- Difficulty 4: -15% for attackers, +15% for clean sheets
- Difficulty 5 (Hardest): -30% for attackers, +30% for clean sheets

## Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome (recommended)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari
- ✅ Edge
- ✅ Mobile browsers (responsive design)

## Privacy & Data

- All data is fetched directly from the official FPL API
- No user data is stored or transmitted to third parties
- Your FPL Team ID is saved only in your own browser (`localStorage`) and never sent anywhere
- Theme, language, and kit preferences are also stored locally in your browser

## Customization

### Switching Teams
Use the **Change ID** button in the app header — no code changes needed.

### Default Team ID (optional, for self-hosted deployments)
If you want to pre-fill a Team ID for a specific deployment:
1. Open `fpl-api.js`
2. Set the `TEAM_ID` default value:
   ```javascript
   TEAM_ID: YOUR_TEAM_ID_HERE,
   ```
3. The Guardian onboarding will still let users override this with their own ID.

## Known Limitations

- Predictions are estimates based on historical data and may not account for:
  - Unexpected team news
  - Weather conditions
  - Tactical changes
  - Player transfers between clubs
- API rate limits may apply during heavy usage
- Some features require active gameweeks
- The FPL API does not expose granular defensive stats (tackles, interceptions) — the BPS metric is used as a composite proxy

- League standings integration
- Price change predictions
- Chip strategy recommendations (Wildcard, Free Hit, Bench Boost, Triple Captain)
- Historical season data analysis
- Export / share functionality for reports
